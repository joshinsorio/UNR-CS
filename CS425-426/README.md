# CS-425-Captsone-PLUSH

For their senior project, Team 20 will create a robotic companion that will promote the well-being of patients within the healthcare system. PLUSH, or Pal that Loves Unconditionally and Softly Hugs, is a mechanical stuffed animal designed to provide support, comfort, and companionship to patients in a hospital setting. As a robotic companion, PLUSH will relieve patient stress by mimicking affectionate gestures such as hugging, monitoring patient behavior, and contacting hospital staff when needed using a built-in call button.   

Using these functionalities, PLUSH will aid in alleviating patients of negative emotions to promote better recovery outcomes and a more stable mental state. Given the pandemicâ€™s effect on hospital admittance rates, PLUSH will also reduce the rate of call lights by fighting patient loneliness, increasing the amount of attention and reaffirmation provided to patients. As a tool for social interactions, PLUSH will reduce the workload of hospital staff, allowing hospitals to reallocate their resources to other areas for increased efficiency. As a long-term solution, PLUSH will create a trustful and reliable environment as it will always be there to provide emotional reassurance to distressed patients such as children and the elderly.
